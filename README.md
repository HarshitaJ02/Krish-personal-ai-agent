# Krish -  Production-Grade AI Agent on Telegram
A custom-built ReAct AI assistant with memory, RAG, tool orchestration, and AWS deployment - engineered from scratch without agent frameworks.

## What Is Krish?
Krish is a personal AI agent that lives inside Telegram. It holds conversations, remembers you, searches the web, manages your GitHub repos, writes to Notion, and schedules reminders - all while chaining multi-step tasks autonomously.
It is not a wrapper around LangChain, AutoGen, or any agent framework. Every layer - the reasoning loop, memory system, vector retrieval, intent classification, and tool execution - was designed and built from scratch.
